# Unreal Engine First Person Footsteps Plugin (C++)

An easy-to-use footstep system for first-person adventure games. Does not require animations, supports different footstep sounds and loudness per physical material and action (walk, jump, land).

Made for Unreal Engine and permissively licensed. Hope you find it useful!

## NOT YET FUNCTIONAL

This plugin requires some key assets that will be added to the repository when I sort out their licensing. Once that is done, this message will be removed. Aplogies for inconvenience.
